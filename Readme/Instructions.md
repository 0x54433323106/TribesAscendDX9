1. Download the latest binary (*.dll*) and injector ([*ACDONTOP.exe*]()) from the [*Binaries*]() folder in the repository.
2. Run the injector, set your target process to *TribesAscend.exe* and inject the dll.

(**WARNING**: Having certain injectors, like *Extreme Injector*, running while playing a VAC secured game can get you **VAC banned** even if you are not injecting to the process).
